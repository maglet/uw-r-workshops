# R workshops for researchers
UW-Madison libraries are offering R programming Workshops on R programming for researchers. The intended audience is anyone at the univerity who is working with tabular research data (including graduate students, faculty, research staff, and undergraduate researchers) and would like to learn how to automate data processing using the R programming language. The content is based heavily on the R Ecology Data Carpentry content, but will cover useful skills for anyone working with tabular data. Later sessions go beyone the Data Carpentry Lessons to cover how to use git version control within R Studio and writing reproducible reports using RMarkdown.
